## Test fizz-buzz :

This project implements a web server that will expose a REST API endpoint that:

* First API Accepts five parameters : three integers int1, int2 and limit, and two strings str1 and str2,
and returns a list of strings with numbers from 1 to limit, where: all multiples of int1 are replaced by str1, all multiples
of int2 are replaced by str2, all multiples of int1 and int2 are replaced by str1str2.

* Second API allows users to know what the most frequent request has been.
